# lab_plan shiny app

- version: 1.0.0 (2024-04-04)

- **NB: see CHANGELOG also**

## Description of app

- It's a shiny app for making lab plans.
- **Idea and how it works**: It will be hopefully hosted at <shinyapps.io>
    - The user chooses the specifics of the study (like data type) and selects an output folder
    - The app then generates the lab plan named: Lab plan study_name.docx in the selected folder.
- **The lab is based on input_at_start/lab_plan_app_inputs.rds made using development/labplan_tables.R**
    - Whenever new protocol versions are released, I should update this file!
